## Simple Text Generation with Markov Chains

This repository implements a simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains.

Markov chains are a statistical method for modeling sequences of elements, where the probability of the next element depends only on the current element and a fixed number of preceding elements. 

In this case, we are using Markov chains to predict the probability of the next word in a sequence based on the previous one or two words (bigrams).

## How to Use
